# Felix Uptmoor

Hi, my name is Felix Uptmoor. 
I'm calculation engineer at a manufacturer of agricultural machinery. 
My task is automation and standardization in FEA strength analysis and CAE workflow.

I’m interested in technical mechanics and maths, technical computing and data processing.


I'm currently working on processing strain gauge measurement data.
I’m looking to collaborate on interface tools between tdm/tdx data and python.
